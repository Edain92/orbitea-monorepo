# Orbitea *"Creating Smart Journeys"*

An Integrated System to Organize and Optimize Personal Trips

## Abstract

This project aims to develop a personalized travel management system, which utilizes advanced software architecture techniques, including **DDDD** (Domain Driven Design), **Design Patterns**, and **CQRS** (Command and Query Segregation of Responsibilities). The proposed system, entitled **Orbitea**, will be a web application that will provide users with a comprehensive platform to organize and optimize their travel plans.

## Project Description

**Orbitea** will allow **users** to create their **trips** where they will upload all the infomation and documents related to it, including transportation tickets, invoices and other receipts. Users will be able to indicate the dates of their trip and the location of the accommodation.

A prominent feature of the application will be the proposal of **personalized itineraries**. Based on the user's tourism interests, travel dates and budget, the application will generate suggested itineraries. For this functionality, the GPT-4 generative language model will be integrated. This integration will allow **Orbitea** to provide dynamic and well-founded itinerary proposals for users.

## Impact

By providing an integrated platform for travel management, **Orbitea** has the potential to simplify and enhance the travel planning experience for users. In addition, the implementation of advanced software architecture techniques will enable the development of a robust and scalable application that can adapt to changing user needs and market conditions.
